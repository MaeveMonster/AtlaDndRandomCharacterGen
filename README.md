# AtlaDndRandomCharacterGen
This java console application helps the user to create a character to use in Avatar the Last Airbender Dnd, following the rules created by Conor McKee. It prompts the user for an element, a gender, and a level for their character and from there it randomly generates a character and displays its information for the user.
