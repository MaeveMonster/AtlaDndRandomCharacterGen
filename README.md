# AtlaDndRandomCharacterGen
This java console application helps the user to create a character to use in Avatar the Last Airbender Dnd, following the rules created by Conor McKee. It prompts the user for an element, a gender, and a level for their character and from there it randomly generates a character and displays its information for the user. See the ATLADndRules.pdf for the full description of the rules. You can find a character sheet in ATLACharsheets.pdf.

Known Bugs:

(FIXED 9/5/2018) The user frequently has to enter their input several times before anything happens.

The once the user has entered all of their input, the program occasionally times out while creating the character and needs to be restarted.


Something I learned: I gained some experience in java. Even though I used java in highschool, I've only used it for one project in college, which was for a class so I didn't really get to be all that creative. I wanted to do a personal project in java so that I had a little more freedom in it. I also leanred a bit about storing data in trees. I used trees to store all the bending skills that its possible for a character to use.


House benefit: CSHers can use my generator to learn how to play this awesome version of Dnd! (I plan to put this on a website eventually)


Time spent: about 20 hours
