# AtlaDndRandomCharacterGen
This java console application helps the user to create a character to use in Avatar the Last Airbender Dnd, following the rules created by Conor McKee. It prompts the user for an element, a gender, and a level for their character and from there it randomly generates a character and displays its information for the user.

Known Bugs:
The user frequently has to enter their input several times before anything happens.
The once the user has entered all of their input, the program occasionally times out while creating the character and needs to be restarted.
